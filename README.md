### TODOS

1. Create time interval options for the cash-invested chart:

    * a month

    * a year

    * all

2. Add search bar in the lower section of the page. When user types in any thing, try to search and filter any content that has the words entered.

3. Improve the appearance of the trade record table.

### Things that has problem to realize

1. Draw a graph that describe the fluctuation of the holding-securities' market value.

    If a user suddenly add a trade record that happened many years ago, the local backend server then need to query lots of historical data from the remote server and then store all of them, which is very time and space-consuming.
    Moreover, if the action that user had done is just "by mistake", the whole process will then be considered waste of both time and space.
